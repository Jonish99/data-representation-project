## The Risk Register
This project is a attempt to replicate a MS Access application in my work place with the context of the assigmen brief.

The purpose of the risk register is to allow the director of corporate service to assess risks to organisation activity and put into place control measures and periodically review the risks

Functionality included:
Archiving of risks rather deleting risks(in the context of the assigment, once risks are achived, they can they then be deleted.)
Highlighting risks due for review. The frequency of risk review is determined by the Risk level, this in turn is a function of likelihood and impact of the risk. 

On ids: The applications has a unique id for risks on the database and this used for under the cover access of the risk. However, an addional risk id exists for the application users giving meaning to a risk by number and prefix. This is generated from the risk category. This funcionality relies on 

Because my risks have server side processing, such as rid, frequency etc, and reviewdates the risk register reloads the risks list from the server  after a new risk is added or a risk is updated.
